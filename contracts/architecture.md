Certainly, here's a more detailed architecture using specific technologies and including schema proposals for storing data from NordPool and Invertus. Please note that this architecture is a suggestion and can be adapted to your specific requirements and technology stack.

**Architecture Overview:**

![Data Ingestion and Storage Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/f9QgYVU.png)

**Components:**

1. **Data Ingestion Layer:**
   - Use Apache Airflow for orchestrating data ingestion tasks.
   - Create dedicated Airflow tasks to fetch data from NordPool and Invertus APIs using API keys.
   - NordPool data can be fetched and transformed into JSON using Python scripts or Airflow operators.
   - Invertus data can be fetched using Python scripts that call the Invertus API and transform the data.

2. **Data Storage Layer:**
   - For NordPool Data:
     - Use PostgreSQL as a relational database to store NordPool data.
     - Table Schema:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE nordpool_prices (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            geographical_area VARCHAR(50),
            hour TIMESTAMP,
            value DECIMAL,
            inserted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        );
        ```
   - For Invertus Data:
     - Use TimescaleDB, an extension of PostgreSQL optimized for time-series data, to store Invertus data.
     - Table Schema (example for illustration):
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE inverter_data (
           id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
           inverter_id INT,
           timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
           metadata JSONB,
           meter_readings JSONB,
           inserted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
       );
       ```

3. **Data Access Layer:**
   - **APIs for Frontend and Analysis:**
     - Use Flask, a micro web framework, to create APIs.
     - Create API endpoints that query the respective databases to fetch data.
     - Apply appropriate authentication mechanisms for API security.
   - **Battery Optimization Algorithm:**
     - Integrate your battery optimization algorithm with the API layer to access the required data for making optimization decisions.

**Benefits:**

1. **Reliability:** Using Apache Airflow for data ingestion ensures reliable execution and scheduling of data retrieval tasks.

2. **Efficiency:** PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB are chosen for structured and time-series data storage, respectively, for efficient querying and management.

3. **Scalability:** TimescaleDB's scalability features handle large volumes of time-series data.

4. **Flexibility:** The use of APIs allows seamless integration with your frontend, analysis tools, and optimization algorithm.

5. **Maintainability:** Containerization (e.g., Docker) can be employed for easy deployment and scaling of components.

Remember that the choice of technologies and schema details should align with your organization's expertise, cloud provider, and specific requirements. This architecture provides a solid foundation for efficiently ingesting, storing, and accessing data from NordPool and Invertus for various use cases within your ecosystem.
